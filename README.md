I never really intended to upload this, but when I finished making it I was proud of it, so I decided I should upload it. Let me know what you think!

This is a commandline program intended for minecraft, to calculate on average how many mobs you need to kill or blocks you need to mine to get a certain number of items.
Simply input a chance, a lower and upper limit for the amount of items you get per block/mob, and the number you need, and it's good to go!
